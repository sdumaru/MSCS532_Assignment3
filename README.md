Assignment 3 of MSCS 532 course

## Randomized Quicksort and Hashing with Chaining: Implementation, Analysis and Comparison
This assignment delves into the implementation of Randomized Quicksort, an enhanced version of the standard Quicksort algorithm, and a hash table utilizing hashing with chaining. The goal is to analyze the performance of Randomized Quicksort and design a hash table with a universal hash function to minimize collisions.

## Files
- 'Assignment3_Report.pdf' : A comprehensive report detailing the implementation, analysis, comparisons, and applications of Randomized Quicksort and hashing with chaining.
- 'hash_table.py' : Python implementation of Hash Table using a universal hash function.
- 'randomized_quicksort.py' : Python implementation of a randomized quicksort.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository using the command: git clone https://github.com/sdumaru/MSCS532_Assignment3.git
2. Ensure python is installed in your system.If not, download and install it from the official website.
3. Navigate to the repository directory: cd MSCS532_Assignment3
4. Execute the code with the command: python .\hash_table.py or python .\randomized_quicksort.py

## Summary
This assignment illustrates how using a random pivot element can enhance the efficiency of Quicksort across diverse input datasets. It includes the implementation and analysis of Randomized Quicksort, comparing its performance against Distribution Quicksort with various input sizes and distributions. Additionally, it covers the implementation of hashing with chaining in a hash table and evaluates the time complexity of operations such as insertion, search, and deletion.
